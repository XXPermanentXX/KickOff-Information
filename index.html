        <p class='compact'>Context: The rapid advancement of technology has led to a significant digital divide between
            individuals and communities with access to technology and those without. Underprivileged communities are
            particularly affected by this divide, which limits their access to essential services, educational
            resources, and employment opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the urgent need for
            bridging the digital divide to ensure that individuals and communities are not left behind in the rapidly
            evolving digital landscape.

            The challenge for students is to develop innovative and sustainable solutions to bridge the digital divide
            in underprivileged communities. This will involve identifying the specific needs of the target communities,
            exploring different digital tools and technologies that can be leveraged, and designing strategies for

            description:</b>
        <p class='compact'>Context: The digital divide is a societal challenge that continues to widen due to the rapid
            advancement of technology. Underprivileged communities, including low-income families, rural communities,
            and marginalized groups, lack access to essential digital services, resources, and employment opportunities.
            The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the urgency to bridge the digital divide to ensure that no one is
            left behind in the increasingly digital world.

            During the summer school, students working on this challenge will go through a business modelling and
            planning process to develop innovative and sustainable solutions for bridging the digital divide in
            underprivileged communities. They will collect relevant data in a 2-week frame, including interviewing
            community leaders, government officials, and technology experts. Students will describe the potential
            solutions from a customer-centric perspective, identifying the specific needs of the target communities and
            exploring different digital tools and technologies that can be leveraged.

            The ultimate goal is to develop a clear and concise roadmap for bridging the digital divide in
            underprivileged communities. This should include a detailed description of the proposed solution(s), their
            feasibility, impact, and sustainability. The final result should be a comprehensive plan that can be
            implemented and sustained in underprivileged communities.

            your case during the second year of the Master School?:</b>
        <p class='compact'>Yes</p><b>Challenge context:</b>
        <p class='compact'>Legal compliance is essential for any business operating in today's world. Companies have to
            comply with a variety of legal regulations and requirements, including tax laws, labor laws, data protection
            regulations, and environmental laws, among others. These regulations often change, and businesses need to
            stay updated with the latest developments to avoid penalties and legal issues. For instance, data protection
            laws require businesses to collect, store, and use data ethically and lawfully. (think GDPR)

            An AI-powered platform could assist businesses in staying compliant by automating legal processes,
            monitoring changes in regulations, and providing real-time insights on compliance status. The platform could
            also help businesses manage documents, or minimise legal disputes.

            For example, an AI-powered platform could automatically check a company's job postings to ensure they are
            compliant with labor laws. It could also provide alerts and suggestions when changes in regulations occur,
            such as new environmental laws that impact a company's operations. In the case of "gatekeeper" companies, it
            could even serve as a compliancy checker for the new Digital Markets Act. By using AI technology,
            organisations can streamline their legal compliance processes, reduce risks, and focus on their core
            operations. What about implementing this AI from an economic law enforcement perspective?</p><b>Challenge
            description:</b>
        <p class='compact'>One of the challenges faced by businesses today is the increasing pressure to comply with
            complex legal requirements and regulations. The legal framework is slowly, but constantly, evolving and
            remains a steady contributor to a company's costs. Non-compliance can result in heavy penalties, damaged
            reputation, and even legal action. This has created a need for a more efficient and streamlined way for
            businesses to manage their legal operations. However, traditional legal solutions are time-consuming,
            costly, and often require a team of legal experts. Keeping track of these changes can be difficult,
            especially for small and medium-sized businesses that may not have the resources to hire a dedicated legal
            team, and even large businesses can suffer from this.

            The challenge is to formulate solutions that can help businesses specifically comply with legal requirements
            or processes while also minimizing the burden of compliance. These solutions must be customer-centric,
            offering businesses a product or service that simplifies compliance requirements, minimizes risk, and saves
            time and money. It must also provide accurate and timely updates on any legal changes that may affect the
            company, allowing them to adjust their operations accordingly. The properties of what a law is and the
            underlying legal processes should be explored to be able to formulate solutions, however no actual knowledge
            about the contents of a law is theoretically necessary. An important question, what is the optimal balance
            between fully automating legal processes using AI technology, and retaining human oversight and
            decision-making by company lawyers?

            What is important is that the scope of your end product or service is not fixed, and it remains up to you to
            define it through your research. Be creative, AI can do almost anything.

        <p class='compact'>Air pollution in urban environments poses significant risks to public health and the
            environment. Tackling this issue requires innovative, data-driven solutions that involve multiple
            stakeholders, including local governments, transportation providers, industries, and citizens. Digital
            platforms in smart cities can play a crucial role in facilitating data sharing, collaboration, and
            sustainable practices to reduce air pollution.</p><b>Challenge description:</b>
        <p class='compact'>The objective of this challenge is to develop an advanced multi-sided digital platform that
            tackles urban air pollution by actively engaging key stakeholders and implementing data-driven solutions.
            Students will create a platform that stimulates collaboration among local governments, transportation
            providers, industries, and citizens, promoting sustainable behaviors and data-driven decision-making to
            alleviate air pollution in cities.

            During the challenge, students will:

            • Identify the unique challenges and pain points faced by various stakeholders to design a comprehensive
            business model and plan for the digital platform that addresses their needs and interests.
            • Collect and integrate relevant data related to air pollution, traffic patterns, and emission sources,
            using existing databases or, possibly, reaching out to experts and organizations.
            • Propose cutting-edge, data-driven strategies to minimize air pollution, such as applying machine learning
            algorithms to optimize traffic flows, encouraging clean and shared transportation options, and devising
            dynamic emission reduction policies for industries.
            • Design an adaptive user interface that tailors air quality information to citizens and businesses,
            empowering them to adopt more sustainable practices and make data-driven decisions.
            • Establish robust feedback and evaluation mechanisms to assess the platform's impact on pollutant
            emissions, user behavior change, and overall improvements in urban air quality.

            As a final result, students should present an all-encompassing business plan, comprising a detailed
            description of the platform's structure, data integration strategies, innovative solutions, user interface
            design, and a plan for measuring its effectiveness in reducing urban air pollution and promoting sustainable
            behaviors.</p></div>

        <p><b>Daniel Esteban Zanelli Sanhueza</b></p>
        <p><a href='mailto:zanelli.93@gmail.com'>zanelli.93@gmail.com</a> | <a href='tel:N/A'>N/A</a></p><b>Limit of
            Participants:</b>
        <p class='compact'>Yes. The more the merrier.</p><b>Would you consider continuing working on your case during
            the second year of the Master School?:</b>
        <p class='compact'>Yes</p><b>Challenge context:</b>
        <p class='compact'>Developing, testing and deploying Automation and IoT solutions demands a lot of resources
            when it comes to time, skilled effort and capital. In the B2B sector, building robust implementations
            requires custom-made client-specific solutions, which can be cumbersome for both parties. There are also
            pricing, scalability, security and privacy concerns when developing Automation/IoT solutions for a business
            client.

            Aether is a framework to build, test and deploy automata capable of implementing a full control loop locally
            in the clients' hardware. These automata's hardware and logic can be configured through the cloud, while a
            customizable dashboard cloud app is capable of monitoring and controlling various sensors and actuators for
            an arbitrary IoT or Automation implementation.</p><b>Challenge description:</b>
        <p class='compact'>The challenge is to frame the potential business structure Aether could implement to
            consolidate itself as a reliable business. For example, implement a freemium model where the cloud services
            (like IoT and inter-automata communication) are priced on tiers depending on the scale required by the
            clients, while the free version would be used as a locally-run software tool that can help developers create
            new automation solutions by easily integrating commonly available hardware into a control loop.

            Our potential client is someone who can profit from implementing IoT and/or Automation solutions, either in
            their current business or by launching a startup. We can help them build, test and deploy their solutions
            without the unnecessary high effort required to integrate hardware and logic to create their custom
            solution, with the flexibility to scale with their needs. We can cater to diverse industry sectors that have
            a common need for smart hardware: startups, industrial automation, IoT, logistics, farming,
            education/research, among many others.

            As a result of this challenge we expect some potential business structures, monetization mechanisms,
            customer-centric solutions we can offer, potential marketing strategies and a course of action for these
            initial steps for the business.</p></div>

        <p class='compact'>Yes. No preference for the maximum number</p><b>Would you consider continuing working on your
            case during the second year of the Master School?:</b>
        <p class='compact'>Yes</p><b>Challenge context:</b>
        <p class='compact'>There is a decisive lack of specialist doctors which is especially true for the field of
            rheumatology in Germany. This leads to patients having to wait on average 21 months until they get an
            appointment at a rheumatologist which decreases the chances of living a symptom-free life significantly.
            Even after being transferred from a general practitioner, the waiting time is still around 1 to 3 months.
            One cause is, general practitioners commonly don’t think of rheumatism as their first diagnosis because it
            is a rather rare disease, so they try out different treatment methods for other possible causes in the
            beginning. Another cause is the lack of rheumatologist, which makes it difficult for all the possible
            rheumatism patients to get a timely diagnose. </p><b>Challenge description:</b>
        <p class='compact'>Around 60% of the patients that go to a rheumatologist turn out not to have rheumatism in the
            first place. Consequently, a substantial amount of appointments are blocked by patients who do not have
            rheumatism. Conversely, if we could rule out the non-rheumatism patients before they get an appointment it
            would allow rheumatism patients to get appointments a lot faster since up to 60% of the time slots would now
            be freed. Hence, if we could automatically pre-screen patients for the likelihood of having rheumatism we
            could lower the amount of patients that have to be seen by a rheumatologist. An idea to reduce this
            bottleneck could be a rheumatism specific symptom checker application. It could work in a way where the
            patient or a general practitioner would insert their symptoms in the tool which then would put out the
            probability of the patient having rheumatism. If the chance is above a certain threshold the doctor would
            then transfer the patient to a specialist. To improve the transfer time and secure an appointment even
            quicker this step could also be automated. The tool could synchronise with the rheumatologists calendar and
            could find a free slot that fits. Later the tool could also be transferred to use it to diagnose different
            diseases with a similar problem.</p></div>

            to have a support in terms of the business plan, considering the specific market of the north of Italy. Here
            we can find a lot of cities with many Small and Medium Enterprises and with high population density, well
            connected to one another thanks to important highways. That is a deep and enormous potential for SiWeGO.
            According with our B2B/B2C model, our first, real communication campaign will have three main targets:
            1. Transportation SMEs;2. SMEs that need to ship goods;3. Consumers, such as students and off-site workers,
            commuters, and regular e-shoppers (our early adopters).

            For each different target audience, we will implement a different type of communication and related
            channels, online and offline. In order to disseminate we need social media channels, such as Facebook,
            Instagram, and Linkedin. These social media platforms will give us brand awareness. The goal is to increase
            the number of downloads and subscriptions. Students could give us a renewed view on customer needs, market

        <p class='compact'>Until today, delivering items to family, friends or strangers required the services provided
            by a courier or a public agency. Now, with SiWeGO, it is possible to get the same services from private
            citizens and professional couriers who wish to optimize their resources, be social, and protect the
            environment.

            SiWeGO is a web platform (a website and an app designed for smartphones and tablets) that connects people
            who have combined needs in the field of mobility and do not know each other: people who wish to send
            something and people who wish to carry and deliver goods. A virtual platform (Android, iOS, Web) allowing
            both private users and professional drivers to deliver goods on behalf of third parties, sharing their own
            vehicle and itinerary, in order to prevent empty runs and to save environmental costs.

            SiWeGO purposes an integrated ecosystem for smart delivery of goods, in which car-sharing is oriented to
            shipping goods and tangible products: a kind of Uber specific for commodities. SiWeGO matches persons
            needing to ship goods, with drivers willing to transport those goods and share the same road section,
            quickly and efficiently.

            In the business model app download is free for all private users (senders & transporters), defined as SiWeGO
            Easy, to distinguish them from SiWeGO Company, which are companies who can only send goods, and from SiWeGO
            PROfessional, which are SMEs of transport. Revenues come from:
            1- selling subscription to transport SMEs (SIWEGO PROfessional), to allow app download and access to our
            innovative “freight exchange”, and
            2- 7% fees on each transaction for each delivery of goods, commissioned from senders to transporters.
            The increasing capillary diffusion of mobile devices, with intensive network connection among people, has
            made access to e-commerce easier. Accordingly, the delivery market developed, due to a higher and higher
            flow of online sold products. Moreover, according to the EU, 24,5% of trucks, in Europe, travel empty.

            According to this, the aim of the project is to make every vehicle a fruitful way for shipment, helping to
            avoid expensive empty runs, offering the advantages of a private car, by optimizing the empty space of a
            proprietary car or transport vehicle, with subsequent reduction of overall costs, optimizing resources, gain
            money and reduce traffic as well as environmental pollution.</p></div>

        <p class='compact'>ESG in the construction industry is the new challenge for the sector. The regulatory
            framework remains still vague at EU level, thus companies rely on internal protocols to comply with.
            The main pillars for ESG compliance in the construction industry are waste management and carbon emissions
            tracking. The technology implementation could work mostly in the IoT sector as carbon emissions belong to
            different scopes. The different scopes need different technologies as they include power consumption,
            machineries, employee commuting and many other.
            Embneusys, as a sensor company, would like to provide a robust solution in the IoT spectrum that will enable
            construction companies to simplify the ESG data collection process.
            Health & Safety departments at every site are responsible for collecting those data, losing a lot of
            manhours and causing distraction for daily operations.
            The key aspect in this category is the data trustworthiness and how reliable can they be for further
            analysis. The collection process and analysis will lead to a solid product-market fit in the future.</p>

        <p class='compact'>As a growth yet deeptech startup, we face a real challenge to show short-term traction in
            order to attract investors. We must therefore accelerate the sale of our RedSnow and DarkSnow stand-alone
            solutions, although the licensing business model for these products is different from our royalty-based
            mid-term and long-term business model (our products are to be integrated in broader cybersecurity and ICT
            services and products). There seems to be an obvious need but the market is probably a “niche” market and
            going European would broaden our reach while helping us build and deploy our Snowpack network across Europe
            and beyond.

            We therefore need a market analysis of the overall European market (and its main sub-market)  for each
            product:

            - number of companies selling pentesting services, number of pentesters, analysis of the competition (VPN,
            Tor, VM), estimation of the value, estimation of the price…

            - number of LEA officers doing online investigations and number of CTI analysts, potential regulation
            constrains on public procurement, analysis of the competition (VPN, Tor), value, price…

        <p class='compact'>Yes</p><b>Challenge context:</b>
        <p class='compact'>Snowpack is a one-year old spinoff from CEA, the largest French applied research center.
            Snowpack develops and operates the first invisibility overlay network that aims at overturning the
            trust-based digital security paradigm: even if any element of the trust-chain in the infrastructure is
            compromised the attacker will not be in a position to intercept or modify users’ data on the Internet.</p>
        <b>Challenge description:</b>
        <p class='compact'>One year after its incorporation, Snowpack has been recognized by the French government and
            the French cyber ecosystem has one very promising technology company: our two R&D projects have been
            selected by the French Cyber Strategy Acceleration, we are part of the three startups selected for the
            Hexatrust accelerator and we appear in Wavestone French cyber radar 2022. Our R&D roadmap is still ambitious
            but we already have achieved a beta production network running across 4 EU countries and a freemium limited
            product (c.f. https://snowpack.eu). Our main challenge is now to accelerate the business side.

            Our Snowpack Overlay Network can be used for high-end security purposes as described in Company description
            (cf above) but also for network anonymization. We have chosen this latter use-case as our preferred market
            access strategy as our network presents a very strong added-value compared to other anonymization networks
            (VPN, Tor, I2P, Nym…). We have therefore recently defined and packaged two new products : 

            - RedSnow : targeting pentesters, red teams and bug bounties companies, this product enables a pentester to
            attack a client system from various part of the Internet in order to identify potential vulnerabilities
            without having to build and maintain its own infrastructure;- DarkSnow : targeting Law enforcement agencies
            (LEA), cyber threat intelligence companies, OSINT and economic intelligence companies, DarkSnow enables
            investigators and analysts to perform their operations on the clearweb, deepweb and darknets while hiding
            their identity to everyone, even us (contrary to all other anonymization solutions there is absolutely no
            trusted third party in Snowpack).

            Since June we have tested these products on the French market and the response has been very positive so
            far. To increase our traction, we would now like to prepare our move into the European market and therefore
            want to estimate the overall European market size and its main sub-markets (e.g. Germany, Spain, UK,
            Italy…). In addition, we would be interested in building a market penetration strategy for these two
            products in these sub-markets, bearing in mind that there is at least two very different topologies of
            clients (i.e. public and private ones).</p></div>

        </p><b>Limit of Participants:</b>
        <p class='compact'>The Praim products ecosystem provides an integrated set of solutions covering with a reach
            set of features and services a very wide and varied space of user requirements, and an extremely wide scope
            of use cases and applicative sectors. 


            Currently, both our client-software and our centralized-management-console are licensed with a subscription
            plan on a yearly base.  These products provides crosswise to all customers and sectors all the different
            product capabilities, regardless the specific set of features in use of the customer and regardless the
            peculiarities customer business sector. 

            License fees can vary only between the standard and the advanced (offering more specific and complex
            capabilities) use of the products, that are finely configurable for all the different user goals and needs.


            The challenge is to transform our current go-to-market strategy to better face our competitive scenario and
            approach new promising market sectors.  In particular, we aim at exploring the potential benefits and risks
            of a new go-to-market strategy allowing us to explore the following manyfold directions:


            1. Increase the competitiveness of our products/services with a more differentiate and customized
            proposition, both in terms of product capabilities and prices, allowing users to choose among incremental
            options satisfying needs from basic (low-requirements and low-expend) to complex use cases.


            2. Move from the current comprehensive product proposition to a new use-case/business-vertical driven
            approach. 

            We aim at understanding the business potential of defining alternative product proposition matching the main
            different use case or market priorities (e.g. Mobility, Control & Security, Customization & UX, ...). 

            We target, in particular, the promising and currently under-exploited (for Praim) market of Manufacturing,
            where digital devices controlling machineries in industries are rapidly wide-spreading but where IT
            management support is still extremely limited.


            3. Offer centralized endpoint management capabilities according to the “as a Service” paradigm, switching
            from to the current all-inclusive approach to a suite of freely combinable, specific services that can be
            used at need and paid at consumption.


            We expect an assesment/analysis of the differencies and potential gains and risks arising from the
            alternative go-to-market options exposed. Moreover, a valuable output would be also a proposal (driven from
            the current competitive scenarios and a market analysis) of the potential product setup/composition to
            approach the different/new sectors and user requirements. Of course, given the 3 possible directions above
            listed, also the contribute to only one or two of them can be considered, as well as different contributes
            from different students groups targeting two different subsets of them.</p><b>Would you consider continuing

            and scale-up efficiently in the administration of heterogeneous and territorially distributed devices.


            In particular, we offer to IT administration complete solutions for the automation of a massive number of
            endpoints, that allow companies to fully cover the workflow of creation, monitoring and management of all
            their digital workplaces, even in mobility. Our ICT solutions include dedicated Operative Systems,

            Virtual Desktop environments, supporting small to large companies in protecting and governing their digital
            infrastructures.


            Praim's solutions cover the Unified Endpoint Management use cases, providing different integrated solutions
            enabling companies to flexibly, efficiently and seamless manage all their digital devices (potentially
            distributed in all the corporate office, branches or plants) with a standardized level of services and
            quality, while enabling fully customizable configuration for devices deployment, control and management
            processes. 


            Digitalization and remote working significantly transformed the productive processes of all productive and
            service sectors. 

            IT departments of all companies are often overloaded with every-day operational tasks and big infrastructure
            projects, struggling to preserve efficiency and cyber security. These are the sort of tasks that keep the
            company working properly and can’t be ignored. 


            The goal of Praim is to simplify IT management providing all the needed tools to:

            • Manage and control all the endpoints from one location (also from remote)

            • Secure this management and strengthen device security wherever such endpoints are

            • Support any kind of device and any kind of operating system

            • Enable a flexible, customizable and effective end-user experience

            • Automate all the management task to support scale-up (up to hundreds of thousands of devices) at reduced
            effort


            In particular our products include the centralized management console (called "ThinMan") and the client
            software agent adapting to any kind of endpoint system (called "Agile").</p></div>

        <p class='compact'>MEEVA exploits virtual reality to improve social and relational skills of teens and young
            adults with special needs like Autism and ADHD</p><b>Challenge description:</b>
        <p class='compact'>The recent pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies in all sectors;in
            healthcare, novel solutions for telemedicine are emerging where Virtual & eXtended Reality (VR/XR) is
            expected to play a major role, e.g. to perform mental health therapies from remote. VR-based mental health
            therapy (VRT) for people with NDD is a well-studied subject in research which has proved to be effective in
            improving their life quality.

            MEEVA is a tele-therapy platform composed by: (i) an app running on top of a VR headset exposing NDD teens
            to role-play games aimed at improving their social & emotional skills;(ii) a data-analytics software
            analysing biometrics data collected via wearables and correlating the emotional status of an NDD teen with
            the experience s/he is having during the session. The aim is facilitating ex-post session assessment by the
            therapist while enabling predictive therapy methodologies based on quantified data.

            The unmet need addressed by MEEVA is twofold: (i) excess demand of psycho-behavioral therapies to people
            with ND (ASD, ADHD,...), not matched by capacity for therapeutic services by the Specialised Centers;(ii)
            current teleconference systems are highly ineﬀective with these individuals, as demonstrated in the
            experiences during the pandemic 

            MEEVA brings significant value propositions to its customer and user: (i) all families of NDD teens will be
            finally given the opportunity to access these treatments, while for many of them MEEVA will allow to save
            time and costs incurred to bring their children to SC;(ii) SC can increase their geographical reach and
            market share (i.e. revenues) in terms of number of children treated while decreasing their operational
            costs.</p></div>

            Project (LCAP).</p><b>Challenge description:</b>
        <p class='compact'>Bosch is known to enable autonomous driving and driver assistance services with plenty of
            sensors, control units and complete systems. E.g. ultrasonic parking sensors, mid-range and long-range
            radars, camera systems, precise acceleration sensors for motion detection.

            The trends of automation and advanced assistance seem to extend to other mobility fields (two-wheelers,
            ultra-light mobility, etc.). One might wonder if these technologies would have a market in the world of
            boats?

            Boats are getting more comfortable, with this, the outer dimensions are getting bigger and bigger. The
            marinas worldwide have limited capacity and the docks are created to host as many boats as possible.
            Maneuvering with big boats in the narrow marinas can be very challenging, because of the limited view of the
            captain, the boat's rudder and the moving water and pushing wind also. The small accidents, running into the
            poles, overrunning into the dock can cause damages to the boat's outer coating or even structural damages to
            the hull, which is time and money consuming to get repaired. And sometimes the whole mooring process can be
            nerve-wracking, when you would just like to sail out and relax.

            Generally, a Mooring Assistant System could introduce the automotive parking functions to the leisure boat
            market. The captains would be able to navigate in the marinas between the obstacles easily. The system shows
            the extrapolated trajectory, warns the captain in case of possible collision or with the help of an
            autopilot, it could dock and take-out autonomously. 

            The system would be beneficial to private yacht owners and for charter companies also. The system helps to
            reduce the probability of accidents inside the marinas worldwide.

            With the help of a good visualization, the process of docking will be less intense and would be feasible
            even without extra help from other sailors needed.</p></div>
